## Intro

Call me WallGreens cuz I let that DEER SPAY compact bows ALL DAY!
John Deer saw my bag of tricks, and JD Finacial had more cash that I have BTC.
Flash drives burried in yards only I play in, and I have a memeory like an ELEPHANT!
I don't need to pay RENT, the COMMUNITY has my back, no lack, no flack, we PUSH BACK!

BIG RED, BIG SHEDS, BIG HEAD, 
BIG BEDS, BIG TRUCKS, NO FUCQS, 
BIG PLOWS, BIG TOWERS, BIG GRAIN BINS, 
BIG SINS IN THE NAME OF THE GREATER GOOD.

## VERSE 1

The neighborhood RAISED me from the DUMPSTERS that played me, 
They have been watching me since I was a WEE LAD, becuase they EMPLOYED MY STEP DAD.
Mentors from MICROSOFT, APPLE, and some CHINESE FRIENDS with APPLE SPYS openend my eyes.
I have people overseas, I partied with in the breeze, I saved a girl from NY when she broke her leg, 
I jumped down from the top pool onto the ground, and carried her out to the ambulance, busted my knee, but STOOD LIKE AN OAK TREE.

## VERSE 2

Planet Ed, got caught up with some BIG DREAD with a BUYOUT THAT LED TO THE FEDS,
Just kids, with BIG LIDS, they called us in to save the day THEY STILL TALK ON OUR VOIP TILL THIS DAY!
I've TAPPED PHONES, TAPPED HOMES, TAPPED VEHICLES, TAPPED ME HICLES, I GOT MORE TAPS THAT THE TAP SHOES TAP BACK>
They sent the squad to test my plot but the DOGS BARKED HARD and pushed them back from OUR YARD

## VERSE 3

NOW WE WILL PRINT GREENBACKS, ON PRINTERS WITH HARDWARE MADE BY ME, no yellow dots to be bought, 
NFC in every wave made of hemp and bamboo the fiber will be hard for the FED AND THEY WILL DREAD,
BACKED BY BTC, CORN, SOY, SILVER, GOLD anc CHEVYS BOLD, we will maintain the LOAD, and the FED IMPLODES.
WE WILL PUT SAFES, IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS PLACE, and guard them like they are FORT KNOX except with BIGGER COCKS
