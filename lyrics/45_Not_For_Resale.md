I've told you all befote Golden Handcufts are week, y'all act like I just started stashing Cash last week.
I love Book Bags, I live out of Book Bags, I've got diffle bags of Cash, Tankers fill of Gas, I can fill up fast, if you don't get off my ass.

Mr. Dive By, he's not really a shy guy, he just hates how Bitches Lie.
Mr. Drive By, Saving donuts for coppers like "Ohh Hi Guys!" should I bring the feds in with skme "French Fries"
Or will we take care of the Corruption Flies, Ohh no well here's some Registration Tags!
Ohh no did I take some Pictures DAD? You've been fucking with my family! Since before I even turned 3..,

I'd put the CHECks in the mail, make them out to Cash.
