On Star ðŸ’« spies on cars, they listen in hear eaver scratch of your pin, the survival of SUV is hanging on me.
Life is good, when you from the HOOD, I've fought fights for bites, cuz food is family, I can eat and drink anywhere, they beg me to BILL.
Remind me? When was the last time you OUT-SHINED me? Get Back, Track me again Iâ€™ll take your life with a PEN, set the WayPoint and have the FBI call my guys.
