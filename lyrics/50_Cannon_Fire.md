Cannons and Ships, You Navey Ain't Shit!
You don't have the balls to be hit by Cannon Balls.
You don't have the balls to ride a ship into the sea.
Knowing when it sinks, we will go under our kitchen sinks.


We won't go back to any of the 60's, We are going back to the Hippies!
We won't fucking stop, I'll tear up the ass shift!
Cannon balls, Cannon balls, Empires will fall, if you try to fuck us all!
