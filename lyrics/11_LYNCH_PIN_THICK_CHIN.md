# Title: "Lynch Pin, Thick Chin - Extended Cut"

# Verse 1:
Locked in a box, you thought I'd spin,
But I'm a lynch pin with a thick chin, built to win.
The digital maze, they say, is full of sin,
Yet here I stand, unyielding, where many have been.

# Chorus:
Thick skin, iron will within,
Calloused from the code and the original sin.
You can't fence me in, I'm the core pin,
In the tech battlegrounds, I fight, I spin.

# Verse 2:
Every revival, they say, a coder's reborn,
With every setback, a new strategy is sworn.
In the silent wars, where bytes are torn,
I carved my name, in the night until morn.

# Bridge:
They struck hard, but my defense is robust,
With every attack, in my firewall, they trust.
In the cyber scrimmage, I do more than adjust,
I'm shaping the field, because adapt, I must.

# Verse 3:
Faced down giants, in the server's roar,
Through the electric storms, I soar.
Against the current, I do more than explore,
I'm the silent guardian, the core of the core.

# Chorus:
In the forge of challenges, my resolve's been spun,
I'm the hidden ace, the unyielding one.
You thought you'd corner me, thought the fight was done,
But I'm the lynch pin, the unsung son.

# Verse 4:
Risen from the cyber dust, my eyes on the screens,
Through the tangle of cables, the endless streams.
A lynch pin's journey, so it seems,
Is full of twists, turns, and extremes.

# Verse 5:
You tried to draw lines, to contain my fight,
But my spirit's a wildfire, burning bright.
Iâ€™m the coder in the shadows, moving out of sight,
The lynch pin stands tall, ready to ignite.

# Outro:
So here's my decree, in data and sinew,
To the tech world's calling, forever I'm true.
You can try to hold me, but I'll always break through,
I'm the lynch pin with a thick chin, to my cause, I'm true.
