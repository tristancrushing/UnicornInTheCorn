## "All my bits are brethren"

# Verse 1:
All my bits are brethren, don't you know,

They read my codes and they know where to go.

In the digital shadows, I silently roam,

Master of the web, in this kingdom, I throne.

# Pre-Chorus:
Whispers in the wire, echoes in the code,

In my digital domain, beware the load.

Cross my paths, and you'll soon find,

In the realm of bytes, I'm the mastermind.

# Chorus:
Please don't make any sudden moves,

I'll snap your neck, and leave your network bruised.

In the cyber sea, I'm the lurking shark,

My bite is fierce, my mark is stark.

# Verse 2:
Through firewalls and encryptions, I dance,

In the web's vast expanse, I advance.

A digital wizard, with every trick known,

Into your systems, I've silently flown.

# Bridge:
With a flick of my wrist, your defenses crumble,

In the cyber battle, you're bound to stumble.

My allies are legion, in the data, we trust,

In the digital dust, your systems bust.

# Chorus:
Please don't make any sudden moves,

I'll snap your neck, and leave your network bruised.

In the matrix's depth, I'm the silent ghost,

In the cyber war, I'm the unyielding host.

# Verse 3:
Binary whispers, my command, they heed,

In the digital storm, I'm the seed.

A cybernetic prophet, in the silicon sands,

I hold your fate in my unwavering hands.

So heed this warning, let it be heard,

In the realm of tech, I'm the final word.

All my bits are brethren, in the digital flow,

With me in command, they know just where to go.

# Verse 4:
Codes like soldiers, in formation they align,

To my will, every bit and byte resign.

Across networks vast, my influence spreads,

In the silent digital night, your fears are fed.

# Pre-Chorus Extended:
A network's whisper, a server's sigh,

Under my gaze, the compromised lie.

A subtle shift, a silent decree,

In the binary world, I'm the only key.

# Chorus Extended:
Please, no sudden moves, or you'll find,

In the net's tangled webs, you're confined.

With precision, I strike, a cybernetic bruiser,

Your digital footprint left, a bit and byte abuser.

# Verse 5:
From the shadows, my commands are cast,

A digital footprint vast, from first to last.

An architect of systems, both bold and stealth,

In the currency of data, lies unparalleled wealth.

# Bridge 2:
In the echo of my presence, the internet hums,

To my digital beckoning, the future succumbs.

An unseen force, shaping the digital fate,

In the cyber realm, I eternally create.

# Chorus:
Please don't make any sudden moves,

I'll snap your neck, and leave your network bruised.

In the void of cyberspace, I'm the silent decree,

In the world of ones and zeros, I'm the key.

# Verse 6:
Each byte an ally, each bit a friend,

In the digital battleground, we blend.

A coalition of data, under my command,

Across bytes and bandwidth, we stand.

# Outro Extended:
So remember this lore, as you traverse the net,

In the digital arena, I'm the safest bet.

All my bits are brethren, in unity, they glow,

Under my command, they flow where I say go.
