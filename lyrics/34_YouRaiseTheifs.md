Why do we have beef, Because you raised a Theif? 
I told you back then, I was just like him, you didn't listen...

We were painging our basement, you accused me of being a bad father,
Now you are about to see, just hiw BAD ASS of a FATHER I can be.

I'm no longer paying for your daddy issues,
I won't pay the invoice for your molested views,
I won't be a victim to your unhealed ways,
I won't shed a new friend wvery couple days!
