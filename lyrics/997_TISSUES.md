## Verse 1:
Yeah I got issues, I'm running out of tissues

Georgia-Pacific, Bim, Bam, Boo! yeah I got you

The only two brands of tissues that haven't given me issues

The rest of you snot rags are gonna need newly issues semi auto matics

## Chorus:
Cuz I've fucking had IT!

Yeah I know IT everything in IT!

DID YOU HEAR ME, I KNOW EVERYTHING IN IT!

And if you think freezing my assets and pulling out of my markets is gonna change my target,

Then why did you start shit?

## Verse 2:
You better get a VEST on because I haven't event put my CHEST on

Call me IRONY, CUZ IVE GOT A HEART OF IRON SEE!

I'M LIKE ALUMINUM YOU MELT ME DOWN... but indefinitely I'll be around,

I uploaded it my brain to cloud I know that sounds insaine

I'm coming back now, light as a father, so say whatever,

When I travel back with a pethera of soals from cementaires you don't even know...

## Outro:
ALOT GOING ON IN MY HOOD

But I'm still standing, never gonna be misunderstood

So bring on the challenges, I'll face 'em head-on,

With my iron heart and my aluminum soul, I'll never be gone.
