# Sellout Crowd - Extended Cut

## Verse 1
Stepped onto the stage, with dreams in our eyes,  
Pitching to the crowd, under Silicon skies.  
But the dreams we pitched, and the dreams we sold,  
Got lost in translation, for equity and gold.

## Chorus
Sellout crowd, in suits and ties,  
Counting profits under digital skies.  
Innovation’s soul, once loud and proud,  
Now whispers secrets in a sellout crowd.

## Verse 2
We dreamt of change, of tech that frees,  
But found ourselves shackled, by terms and fees.  
The VC game, with its highs and lows,  
A rollercoaster ride, only the bravest chose.

## Verse 3
Private equity, with its silent stalk,  
Hunting for unicorns, in a market walk.  
Promises of support, of funds to fuel our flight,  
But at what cost, does this support bite?

## Bridge
Once we danced to the tune of creation’s song,  
Now we ponder, where did it all go wrong?  
The essence of our dreams, sold for a price,  
In the market of innovation, every roll's a dice.

## Verse 4
Equity split, the profits sliced,  
The dreamers' share, surprisingly iced.  
From boardroom battles, to the patent fights,  
The journey’s rough, on innovation’s nights.

## Verse 5
Yet, in this dance of dollars and sense,  
A spark remains, fierce and intense.  
The sellout crowd, can’t douse our flame,  
For in our hearts, the dream remains the same.

## Outro
So here’s to the dreamers, caught in the crowd,  
Your voices may be soft, but your visions loud.  
Let not the suits dim your inner light,  
For in the heart of a sellout crowd, you’re the true sight.
