They call me Wall Street Bets, while Wall Street Bets! 
I just made the Games Stop, The Cops BS Stop! We all friends now! 
Lions, Tigers, Bears, Cows, Ducks, Pluck Pluck ðŸ¤­

Google me, Giggle me, Sgwiggle a little bit of a dribble for soke nibble.
But who knows, not me, if hes in my crew, he got you' Kids, ir Elderly! 
She played me, had enemies spray me, sent and deleted, like I was ever bleeding.

I never drive 55 on 55 or 74 on 74, I never trust a sneaky cow, not even one that eat things windy! 
Shifty, Whifty, Lify! No bits, no byte, she stole every flash drive and thin client.
But guess who didn't give up a client, not a one, and guess who still walks under the sun! 

Call me the shade store, cuz i throw shade like it throws up after a night out! 
She can't hang, such a lazy bang, ohh well guess yiu can cry while i do drives...
