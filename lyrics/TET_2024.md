I'm about to collapse bits, and organize hits, keep my name out of you mouth if you don't want to get a byte from the Lion turned Dog at night, 

Spartains don't back down to clowns ðŸ¤¡, Tell your people to call my people before I show up in Washington on your steaple, Biden son has nothing on the chosen one, 

so get the fuck out of my way if you don't wanna play, cuz I am here to stay night and day.



I've been her my whole life, people asking me why I won't leave, this is why... I have a dream, 

I'm tired of the poison in our food an in our streams, so I will secure them by running fiber through every seam.

Don't fuck with me, can't get with me, they can't hit me, I'm the shit see, Big T, Big E, Big T worse that TNT; ðŸ§¨ 



## Food safety: 

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) are responsible for ensuring the safety of the U.S. food supply. They set standards for food production, handling, and labeling. However, there are ongoing debates about the use of certain pesticides, GMOs, and other food additives.


## Water quality: 

The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) regulates water quality in the U.S. through the Safe Drinking Water Act. They set standards for over 90 contaminants in drinking water. However, concerns about lead, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), and other contaminants persist in some areas.

## Environmental impact: 

The use of certain chemicals in agriculture, industry, and everyday life can have negative impacts on the environment. These include pollution of waterways, soil degradation, and harm to wildlife.
Public awareness and action: Many organizations and individuals are working to raise awareness about these issues and advocate for change. This includes supporting organic and sustainable farming practices, reducing the use of single-use plastics, and promoting water conservation.
