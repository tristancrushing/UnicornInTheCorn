## (Verse 1)
I don't need a gun, I got my friends by my side,
They see me rhyme, they know I'm on a ride,
I show respect with my flex, no need to hide,
You can Fucq off if you doubt my stride.

## (Chorus)
All my friends got guns, but I got something more,
The power of my words, I'm knocking on your door,
I'm not about the fame or the money in my hand,
I'm about the love, the truth, and the stand.

## (Verse 2)
I shed tears, I rebuild, I've done it for years,
This ain't no game, it's the truth, it's my fears,
Billionaires in my ears, they whisper in my mind,
But I'm not about the cash, I'm about the grind.

## (Chorus)
All my friends got guns, but I got something more,
The power of my words, I'm knocking on your door,
I'm not about the fame or the money in my hand,
I'm about the love, the truth, and the stand.

## (Bridge)
Respect me, I'll protect you, fear me, I'll flex you,
But in the end, it's all about the love, the truth, the trust,
I'll drop a ho, I'll pick up a harem,
But I'll show respect, I'll be a gentleman.

(Chorus)
All my friends got guns, but I got something more,
The power of my words, I'm knocking on your door,
I'm not about the fame or the money in my hand,
I'm about the love, the truth, and the stand.

(Outro)
So let me flex, let me rhyme,
But in the end, it's all about the time,
The time we spend, the love we give,
The world we change, the hearts we lift.
