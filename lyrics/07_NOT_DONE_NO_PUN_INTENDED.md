## "Not Done, No Pun Intended"

# (Verse 1)
I’m not done, the battle's not won,

You couldn't stop me if you shot me with a shotgun

And left my body out in the hot sun ☀️

But I rise again, like I'm the chosen one.


Faced down the barrel of life's gun,

Counted out, told that I'd be undone.

But here I stand, not on the run,

Fueled by the fights that I've never shun.


# (Chorus)
Because I’m not done, my story's unsung,

Through the fire and flames, my spirit's sprung.

You thought I was finished, that you had won,

But I'm back on my feet, ready to stun.

# (Verse 2)
Been through the wringer, faced the abyss,

Each setback, another hit or miss.

But within me burns a fire, a wish,

To rise from the ashes, to insist, persist.

My journey's mine, a path I carve,

With every scar, a lesson learned, a narrative starved.

In the face of defeat, my resolve’s unmarred,

I’m the master of my fate, my ambition unbarred.

# (Bridge)
You see me struggle, you watch me fall,

But I see victory in every crawl.

For every time I'm pushed against the wall,

I push back harder, I stand tall.

# (Verse 3)
This isn't just my fight, but ours to share,

A chorus of voices in the cold night air.

Together, our dreams, we dare to declare,

In the collective struggle, our solitary despair.

# (Chorus)
Because I’m not done, our story's unsung,

Side by side, in battles won and unstrung.

You thought we were finished, that you had won,

But we're back on our feet, our unity spun.

So here's to the fighters, the dreamers, the brave,

To those who've been knocked down but refuse to cave.

‘Not Done’ is our anthem, our rally to save,

Our spirits unbroken, forever unenslaved."

"Not Done, No Pun Intended"

# (Verse 4)
"In the echoes of my steps, you'll hear a story told,

Of a spirit unyielding, a resolve bold.

Not just surviving, but thriving, redefine the mold,

Crafting destiny with every fold.

# (Verse 5)
Society’s chains, tried to hold me down,

But in their grip, I found my crown.

Wore my scars like jewels, refused to drown,

In the sea of voices, I found my own sound.

# (Chorus Extended)
Not done, not by a long shot, no pun intended,

Against the currents, my path ascended.

You thought the end was what you recommended,

But it’s just the beginning, my spirit untended.

# (Bridge Extended)
From the ashes of doubt, a phoenix rises,

Above the noise, it realizes,

The power of one, when unified, surprises,

Breaking free from traditional guises.

# (Verse 6)
They said I was out for the count,

But I’ve been keeping score, about to surmount.

Each no, each rejection, I proudly recount,

As fuel for my fire, my journey paramount.

# (Verse 7)
No pun intended, but I've rewritten the joke,

Turned their laughter into smoke.

In the mirror of their scorn, my ambition woke,

In the forge of their doubt, my legacy spoke.

# (Chorus Extended)
Because I’m not done, still aiming for the sun,

With every battle faced, not just won but spun.

Into a tale of victory, by the threads I’ve run,

‘Not Done, No Pun Intended,’ till my time is done.

# (Outro Extended)
So hear my voice, a clarion call,

To those who’ve faced the fall.

‘Not Done, No Pun Intended,’ stand tall,

Our stories not ending, but transcending, enthral.
