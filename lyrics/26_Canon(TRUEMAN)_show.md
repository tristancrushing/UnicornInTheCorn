Isn't that RIGHT MR. McGowan! Handlers from a young age, tried to keep my mind caged.
From teachers that held my homework for ransom, until "I plaid(played) by the rules"...
That teacher didn't last long once she was in my sights, I remote viewed my homework, saw her mind, started documenting two at a time.

Half my friends handed in assignments I did, a first draft was never enough, but my friends took them even if a little rough.
In the asylum where they raised me, they tought me that the FuTURE would try ti PHASe ME!
A small group of us, whom I'll never say, were carted away, toight things kids aren't tought TODAY...

Call me the TOMB RAIDER, becuase i was brn in an ESCAPE room, call me the KNIGHT! 
Call me BONES becuase mine are INFUSED with Aluminium! every courve pour metal at the core! 
Call me the fresh PRINCE, becuase i Tinker with Blinkers, and will slap the fuvk out if anyone who touches a lady of mine.

I play woth digits like a noteary, I see all the D12 like I'm in love with the PROOF,
I talk to the same spirits that HAUnT YoU! 
Call me spounge BoB becuaze I LIVE in a PineApple! 

Snapple, or AZ Green Tea? I bet they both support our TEA party. 

Please Step the FUCK back before someoke gets CLAPPED!
