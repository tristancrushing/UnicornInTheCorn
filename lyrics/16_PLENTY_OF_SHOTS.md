## Into

Iâ€™ve got plenty of SHOTS, Iâ€™m like Pfizer,
Iâ€™ll give you a BOOSTER and the COCK or a ROOSTER!
Why did you have to go an push me?
Now I have to make your BRAIN ðŸ§  all MUSHY!

## Verse 1

Iâ€™ve got a different piece of TECH at the CRIB every night!
Playing with her CONFIGS until I get them just RIGHT,
Suddenly they ARCH their BACKS when they see the LIGHT,
She mistakes me for a nice guy, but Iâ€™m just a nice DIE.

## Verse 3

Iâ€™ve got NOTHING against DRIVE BYS, but in my hood you better fly by.
Cuz all my BOYS have EAGLES on their DASH, and all girls are ready to COVER MY ASS!
Itâ€™s about time for the NEXTEL chapter class, I really hope you have a HALL PASS,
MASS GRAVES, MASS RAVES, FAST CARS, FAST DRIVE, SLOW DOWN SAVE OUR LIVES!

## Outro

Iâ€™ve got plenty of SHOTS, Iâ€™m like Pfizer,
Iâ€™ll give you a BOOSTER and the COCK or a ROOSTER!
Why did you have to go an push me?
Now I have to make your BRAIN ðŸ§  all MUSHY!
