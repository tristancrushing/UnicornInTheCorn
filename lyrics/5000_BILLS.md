## (Into) Counterfeit

I’m the reason only $100 bills 💵 exist, I’ve been counterfeiting money since I could clench my fist.
Now I’m printing wealth in bits and bytes, while I let this fake wealth take flight.
I’ve been built since birth for this life, I knew the system was rigged from the brig.
Saw a solution in Silicon Dream, they’ve caught up with me or so it seems, I move faster than a Vamp on VyVance, Whon hasn’t eaten since the Aliens died.

I can shift bits and organize hits online and off with the flick of a wrist, they call me anonymous because I’ve been anonymous!
I have BTC overseas, Croatia has Storage Units they have yet to seize, and Austria 🇦🇹 didn’t seem to like me, maybe now they are trying to spite me?
You can’t touch, come and rush me, I’ll build a suit ♥️ made of ageless iron, in the middle of a machine shed, complete with hydraulics.
They call me the PTO, cuz I run this PTO, don’t get it twisted. 

I’ve been studying my whole life, now you have me boxed 📦 in, and I’m about to stick my cock 🐥 in?
Ask the people around me, ask them if they first heard about BTC from ME? I broke your system, through a VPN from my allies, and we are about to let the missles fly.
I’ve got so much digital cash I could make this pushy readbin BASH.
Don’t fuck with me, Can’t get with me, I’m about to get real BIT Swifty.
