74 was full of Old Dudes, they my dudes, white, black, and every color in between! 
I murder every game I play, real or fake, I'm the GameMaster, The Armored Disater.
Solid Worx, Solid Stake, did he just end that Tank with a gernade? 

Tounge sharp as a knife, Tounge gets me in trouble sometimes.
My flow so hot, you wonder from what realm I'm brought? 
I'm the Jack Of all Trades, Master of Some, no calls me their leader. 
But they all follow my orders, cuz respect is worth more than checks.

I'll never cash a check again, I’ll neber touch a keyboard,
I’ll look at a camera my guys are in, drop my pin, like an accident, 
then what? surprise collapsed drive bys. traffic light sly bys. 
Bartenders love me, Bartenders love me, Chicken Tenders live me!
