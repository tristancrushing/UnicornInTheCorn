I once had a home, hidden in a stack of AT&T Cisco Routers, for a manged network that didn't exists, call me (CX)...

One Hat took one at bat, and ended up, out of the midwest, because I have a BIG CHEST...


Now CyberNotIn, a jy from my home town, wordpressing, who thinks he's sly... HE FORGOT I DO DRIVE BYS! I TRACK FLYS, CALL ME A FROG, CUZ I'M INVISIBLE, IN THIS FOG
