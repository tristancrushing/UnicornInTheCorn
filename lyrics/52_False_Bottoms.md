You race tracks, I clap backs, You hide in your hoise, I roll up on the spot with my DIcK Out.
You hide coke & TAR in false bottoms, I hide killers in my circle and when you come after me, I'll sacrifice myself for my crew dude!
You're fake laws and fake authority is Fake AF bro! My balls are fake too, their IROn now, They spit dust if sperm and drill!
You have a skill issue, I have deep tissues, I have deep issues, I have a brain they cant even fucking explain.
Been finsihing everyones sentences since I was in a kid bin! 

52 I'm after you! Run fast, I shoudn't have to pay for shit that land is mine, my dads money is tired of me playing funny.
Sign over the deed, or get blazed by weed, you can't stop me, the cops can't PoP me, and a hacked phone and AI clone is playing with Mr. Home Alone.
I have traps you've never seen, Honey pots for robots, no stop!
You come at my, it cost a fee, make the check out to cash or DON'T FUCK WITH Me!
