You think you're big, cuz you wear wigs, and work 4 hours,

then take showers, wash off the dirt, but I see you hurt,

You can't catch me, can't get near me, You should fear me, 

I see Corruption, Corruption is rampant, and I'm the man kid.



You better run, cuz I have the SUN * CUZ he's on my side now, 

and he hates lies, he hates drive bys, he hates house flys, he hate BIG LIES!!!!


Some people do things for money and think they are clever and funny, they lie to the people,

from their steaples, then they make trades, behind grass blades, thinking we can't see the corruptions,

it's mysterious  assumption, they don't want nothing, from the spartins, cuz we don't like to be put in cartons,

boxes, or cages, we have bond fires and burn sages, I'm that MAGE KID!



Don't fuck with me, Can't get with me, I'm real shifty, if you stiff me, 

Monsanto kiss my ass bro, I'm that man yo, get the fuck out so, I don't have to bite you,

So I don't have to spite you, So I don't have to prove how insecure your networks are, from my CAR!



I'll build a network, secure from net jerks, then run you out, and laugh out loud, 

trade seeds and secrets, keep the FEDS out of my shit, CIA can eat shit, 

I'm good at secrets, good at encryption spells, you can go ALL GO TO HELL!
