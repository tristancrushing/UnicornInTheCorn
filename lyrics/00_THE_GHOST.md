## Intro:
They call me the ghost, your unyielding web host,
Born from a sour patch kid, he know dispatch kid, please get back kid, don't get snatched kid,
I'll slip into your networks, and fucq up you web jerks,
being a host with the biggest blue raspberries, talking scaries

## Chorus:
CyberSec God, shipping create pods, dev-ing on prod, laying down sod,
Carnipure carntine, and natural caffeine, bipolar 1, or solar sun?
TriTBI's, a tongue so sharp it cuts wings off flies, in online drive bys

## Verse 2:
In the digital world, I'm a cyber sage,
My skills unmatched, like a digital sage,
I'm a ghost in the machine, a digital mage,
Creating a storm in the virtual stage

## Chorus:
CyberSec God, shipping create pods, dev-ing on prod, laying down sod,
Carnipure carntine, and natural caffeine, bipolar 1, or solar sun?
TriTBI's, a tongue so sharp it cuts wings off flies, in online drive bys

## Bridge:
From the depths of cyberspace, I rise like a phoenix,
With my digital prowess, I'm no one's nemesis,
I'm the ghost with the most, in this digital circus,
Leaving a mark in the world, like a digital seraph

## Outro:
CyberSec God, shipping create pods, dev-ing on prod, laying down sod,
Carnipure carntine, and natural caffeine, bipolar 1, or solar sun?
TriTBI's, a tongue so sharp it cuts wings off flies, in online drive bys
