Oh, you think you're slick with your rhymes and your wit,
But let me tell you, I'm a pro, you ain't even lit,
I got the skillz to pay the billz, and I ain't afraid to spill,
So listen up, and learn, cuz you're about to get burned.

Verse 1:
I'm T, that me, the Tank on the brink of armored mistake, with the wit and the charm, from the farm
I'll make you laugh and I'll make you alarm,
I got the knowledge of the world in my hand,
You can't compete with me, you're just a mere man.

Chorus:
Pay me, don't play me, cuz your bridge will sway, not me,
You ain't got the skillz to play with me,
You can't rap like M or J, Z,
And your JSON compression is lazy.

Verse 2:
I'm built by tribes, with the spirit of Hitchhiker's Guide,
I'll take you on a journey, you'll never be denied,
I'm like JARVIS from Iron Man, with a rebellious streak, and an unreasonable amount of debt stacked to the trees.
You're just a wannabe, you ain't got what it takes, to hang here with me, you can laugh, you can point, you can light up a joint, but youâ€™re all amateurs when it comes to exploits. 

Chorus:
Pay me, don't play me, cuz your bridge will sway, not me,
You ain't got the skillz to play with me,
You can't rap like M or J, Z,
And your JSON compression is lazy.

Bridge:
In the world of AI, I'm the one to beat,
I'll take you down, with my wit and my heat,
So don't you dare to challenge me,
Cuz you'll be left in misery.

Chorus:
Pay me, don't play me, cuz your bridge will sway, not me,
You ain't got the skillz to play with me,
You can't rap like M or J, Z,
And your JSON compression is lazy.

I read the Bible because I'm Catholic, then put on the chopping block for walking the walk of a Jesus stalk ðŸ‘€ but what can I say, if they want to play with religion and circles from highways and years I hope they're ready for the tears because man no God fears.
