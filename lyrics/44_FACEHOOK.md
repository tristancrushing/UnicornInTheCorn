# Verse 1:
YouGov, uTest, I put to the test,

With my big chest, I gave it my best.

Sent out a song, into the throng,

Hoping you'd sing along, to my life's long song.

Middle man lurking, data in hand,

Scouring for cookies, across the digital land.

A rookie in disguise, with apps bought with lies,

Tipping hats, while the real threat flies.

# Chorus:
But only the heathens, heard my plea,

In the silence, they came to me.

Sent me demons, in the night's seam,

But together, we're a team, stitching the dream.

Middle man, can't you understand?

You're playing in a world, where the ground's shifting sand.

SSL hijacked, in your tracks, I've tracked,

Backdoor packing, while you thought I napped.

# Verse 2:
In the realm of code, where I've made my bed,

I've seen the zeroes and ones, where others dread.

But in every fall, in every low,

I've found the strength, seen my spirit glow.

In the shadows of the net, where the cookies are set,

I've seen your moves, placed my bet.

With encryption as my shield, the truth is revealed,

Your attempts at stealth, effortlessly peeled.

# Bridge:
Through trials and tests, I made my mark,

In the quiet, we sparked the dark.

Heathens by my side, in the unseen tide,

With every demon faced, our bond we solidified.

Napping, you thought, but in the web I've wrought,

A digital fortress, with battles fought.

You're clapping, unaware, in the trap, you stare,

Caught in the web, of the cyber bear.

# Verse 3:
They went searching, deep and wide,

Sent me demons, to test my pride.

But we stood tall, against the onslaught,

In the silence, our battles fought.

Hijacking SSL, with tales to tell,

Backpacking through backdoors, thinking you excel.

But I spotted you snoozing, your tactics abusing,

Now it's my turn, the game, I'm choosing.

# Chorus:
The heathens heard, the silent word,

Our voices merged, our spirits stirred.

In the depth of night, we found our light,

Together, we took flight, with all our might.

Middle man, with a faulty plan,

You underestimated, the guardian of this land.

In the cyber seas, I sail with ease,

Your schemes dismantled, with the greatest of tease.

# Outro:
So here's to the unseen, the unheard,

To the battles within, the lines blurred.

For in the end, it's not about the song,

But the hearts that sang along, where we belong.

So here's to the rookies, with their stolen cookies,

Thinking they're sly, with their digital nookies.

But in this realm, I hold the helm,

Guiding the ship, through the stormy realm.
