Big Calls, Take Big Balls, But BB is my Tradition,
I don't have to carry a GuN BeCaUsE mY WhOle HOODs got one!
You ain't gotta like me, the HOOD LOVES ME!

We have kids to raise, weed to blaze, and food to cultivate,
Tired of the POLITICS y'all can eat my big fat dick!
I'll even let you slice it and dice, enough to go around, just ask half the spades on my stompong ground.

I've got Family you'll never find, and FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES,
Now that you've show who my FACE is, I hope your ready for another D12 CD
You have to have an 8 track or you can't PLAY ME!
