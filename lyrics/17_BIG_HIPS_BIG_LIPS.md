Big Hips, Big Lips, Big Guns, Big Sun,
LUNGS FOR DAYS, I breathe air in MANY WAZE,
TECH & GUNS for day, a POTATO will blow right through you,
Looking at a whole in your chest like "DAMN DOG HOW COULD YOU"

I told you before, THAT I'M NOT YOUR WHORE,
Then showed you the door, BUT THEN YOU SWORE,
"To MOP up my floor..." But your forgot about the MAINTENCE,
NOW I GOTTA BUILD A BIG FENCE! NOW I GOTTA PAY SOME BIG RENT!

All these TECH companies PITCHING A TENT,
But their MONEY is about to LOOK REAL FUNNY,
Kennedy is on MY SIDE, CUZ THE GHOST WE RIDE,
Until our CORN & SOY is dried!
