If this is it, this is it, Iâ€™m used to saying fuck it!
I have a black list, I have a fact list, I have a transcript.
Iâ€™ve had all the scripts, Iâ€™ve listened to all the lips.
Itâ€™s not even funny how much money ðŸ’µ the state rakes in from mental health.
If this is it, This is it, Fuck it I quit!

Iâ€™ve been dabbling in, in everying, since I understood the inner workings of my brain ðŸ§ 
Iâ€™ve read books, books fool of facts, and trying to correlate that with science(s) fake ass facts.
I canâ€™t continue, To look through a window! When coos are killing black young men.
Iâ€™ve got a black list! Iâ€™ve got your back kids! I blow big lids.
When my kids donâ€™t get shit! Autism or not, Iâ€™ll blow up this spot! 

I see the evil! I see the corruption! I see all the things, That you guys donâ€™t see coming. 
Fools paradigm, Fools paradise, Neo taught us to open our eyes...
Racism runs rampant in systek designed to make you fail.
Throw me out of the courthouse cuz you are so scared ofnthe truth.
Keep ke iut if the spotlight, keepbke out of the boith.

Chz Pigs are on my blacklist, you better get back kids.
Let me deal with these shit skids. Raling and pillaging us, My patience is BUST!
Cuz I have a BLACKLIST, of Friends who have my back Pigs!
