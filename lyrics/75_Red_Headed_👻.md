When you fall in love with a spy, you always have to be ready to say goodbye.
When you are a spy, and your bug-out bag is gone, cuz your current girl, left hers on the lawn.
You gotta swifty, you gotta get 50, you gotta pish lyrics faster than a squid billy! 

Friends acts silly, they dont’t know me realy, only puzzle pieces. I’m like resees, if i was pieces!
Peanut butter and redheads, sexy robes and great head! I just need one on my bed.
High School sweet hearts, high school meat carts! Champions field, Mitubiti Fielded my body! 

Took you on a farris wheel, when I had my Highschool Appeal, Usually U-High, I hear your friends are Bi 🥰
McLean County Fair, They would all stop and stare looking at us, You’d think we’d arrived on a bus! 
We always looked older, always 4-leaf clovers 🍀, Call me a crazy taxi, get in the back seat.

Throwing rocks at your window, let me grab me a pen 🖊️ though! 
I adored your father, for years you couldn’t be bothered!
I always kept eye on you? knew yiu kept an eye on me too! 

True love is amazing, even though it’s short lived an blazing.
I got all the clues, they left for me and you. 
I just can’t find you, I just feel you, I know where youare.
But we were alwasy clever, just saying whatever! 

S I’m so sorry, It took me so long see 💀
