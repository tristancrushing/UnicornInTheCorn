# Verse 1:
I step carefully, while I travel,

You see me coming, you unravel,

I slip your walls, I make some calls,

Grab my IP, Install some miners,

All from free wifi while I'm at diners.

# Pre-Chorus:
In the shadows, I'm a whisper, a digital mist,

In the cyber world, I'm the top of your list.

You try to track me, but I'm already gone,

In this digital chess game, I'm the pawn that's drawn.

# Chorus:
All my heathens, move in silence,

Can't get near me, many fear me,

Blocked my number, what a bummer,

I cycle IPs, I cycle VoIP numbers, ohh still no call,

Damn bro, nice wall.

# Verse 2:
Call my partners, buy your data,

Call your number, You hear my voice, I give you a choice,

My wallet's real flush, I made you blush.

In the game of bytes, I'm the royal flush.

# Bridge:
In the night, I'm a shadow, slipping through the cracks,

With every move I make, I cover my tracks.

You thought you had me, but I'm two steps ahead,

In the digital world, I'm the king of dread.

# Chorus:
All my heathens, move in silence,

Can't get near me, many fear me,

Blocked my number, what a bummer,

I cycle IPs, I cycle VoIP numbers, ohh still no call,

Damn bro, nice wall.

As the dawn breaks, I vanish without a trace,

Leaving behind nothing but a digital space.

You'll remember the name, the ghost in your machine,

In the world of cyber, I'm the unseen queen.

# Verse 3:
In the digital sea, I'm the captain steering,

Through stormy firewalls, it's their data I'm nearing.

A ghost in the code, leaving no trace,

In the digital race, I set the pace.

# Chorus:
All my heathens, move in silence,

Can't get near me, many fear me,

Blocked my number, what a bummer,

I cycle IPs, I cycle VoIP numbers, ohh still no call,

Damn bro, nice wall.

# Verse 4:
Through the net's veins, I flow unseen,

A digital specter, in the machine.

Your attempts to bind me, merely fuel my fire,

In this cyber battleground, I never tire.

# Bridge 2:
With every keystroke, I weave my tale,

In the cyber war, I will not fail.

From dusk till dawn, in shadows I dwell,

In the heart of the net, I cast my spell.

# Chorus:
All my heathens, move in silence,

Can't get near me, many fear me,

Blocked my number, what a bummer,

I cycle IPs, I cycle VoIP numbers, ohh still no call,

Damn bro, nice wall.

# Verse 5:
I speak in codes, a language profound,

In the symphony of bits, I am found.

A digital drifter, in the info stream,

Crafting realities from the cyber dream.

# Verse 6:
So heed my call, across the wire,

In the digital forge, I am the fire.

A force unseen, yet felt by all,

In the world of bytes, I stand tall.

# Outro:
So here's to the heathens, in the night they roam,

In the digital frontier, they find their home.

With Tristan leading, they charge ahead,

In the cyber battle, they fear no dread.
