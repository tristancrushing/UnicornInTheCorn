## Verse 1:
Bowling and volleyball, they got it all,

Embeseled money, thought it was funny,

Slots and mini golf, cup my balls while I cough,

Look at me with that scoff, as I walk off.

## Chorus:
Alligators, treat pheasants like their peasants,

Family Fun Center, come out for dinner,

I don't sign NDAs, gag orders make my eyes glaze,

You can only hide the truth if you keep me out of the booth.

## Verse 2:
Rip out my fangs, and declain me slain,

My family wants our money, we don't think that it's funny,

You messed with my dead presidents, now you're gonna need a fence,

We on this town now, you will get clowned,

Well burn it down now, build a circle, looking like Steve Erkle!

## Outro:
Make the check out to CASH, and I'll give up coding in BASH,

Give me my stash, the courts can kiss my ass,

I refuse to come in last, to this corruption blast,

I will take out the swamp, even if I need a mop.
