# I've Been Hacking Away

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
When the internet was wild, in a digital fray.  
With my keyboard as my sword, my code as my play,  
I’ve been shaping the web, in my own unique way."

## Verse 1
In the glow of the screen, under the cover of night,  
Crafting scripts and dreams, making the future bright.  
From the hum of the servers, to the data in flight,  
I've been a digital nomad, in the binary fight.

Lines of code like verses, a symphony of thought,  
Breaking barriers, the battles that I've fought.  
From the first "Hello World," to the solutions I've wrought,  
I've been hacking away, every challenge I sought.

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
When the web was a puzzle, in a cryptic ballet.  
With my cursor as my compass, my logic in sway,  
I’ve been navigating nets, in my relentless survey."

## Verse 2
With every keystroke, a step into the unknown,  
Exploring digital depths, where the cyber seeds are sown.  
From dial-up tones to the smartphone's throne,  
I’ve been a part of it all, how the internet's grown.

In the code, I found poetry, in algorithms, a rhyme,  
A rhythm in the chaos, a reason in the prime.  
Through every line of code, through every digital climb,  
I've been hacking away, transcending time.

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
Through the evolution of tech, in its grand display.  
With innovation my guide, and curiosity in array,  
I’ve been crafting the future, with each code that I lay."

## Extended Chorus:
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,
Charting paths unseen, in the tech melee.
With each challenge, a lesson, in the cyber ballet,
Crafting the future, in my own array."

## Verse 3:
From the clack of the keys, to the tap of the touch,
Technology's dance, has changed so much.
Yet my heart remains, in the code's clutch,
A digital pioneer, with the Midas touch.

## In the silence of data, I found my call,
A world wide web, connecting us all.
From the fall of giants, to the rise after fall,
I've been a witness, standing tall.

## Verse 4:
Through the era of hacks, and data breach frights,
I stood my ground, in the encryption fights.
Guarding the gates, through endless nights,
A cyber sentinel, for digital rights.

## The lessons I've learned, from successes and scars,
Are written in code, beneath the digital stars.
In the network of life, we're all avatars,
Exploring the universe, beyond Mars.

## Extended Chorus:
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,
With a vision so clear, in the technological fray.
Where some see chaos, I find the way,
A digital architect, in the endless ballet."

## Verse 5:
Now I look ahead, to the dawn of new quests,
Where AI and quantum, put us to the test.
With each line of code, I aim to invest,
In a future that's brighter, and humanity's best.

So here's to the journey, from past to present,
In a world that's digital, and ever so fervent.
To the coders, the hackers, the tech-savant,
Keep hacking away, let passion be your warrant.

## Extended Chorus:
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,
Finding beauty in bytes, in my own unique way.
Through the spectrum of cyber, in every display,
I’ve been carving out paths, where others may stray."

## Extended Outro:

I know you feel me in your unique way,
Dreams found and lost in the digital fray.
Those apps languishing, unseen by day,
Projects halted in extraordinary ways.

Called to battles where others would flee,
I've stood my ground, let none decree.
To my digital brethren, I've sometimes failed thee,
In our quest to keep this realm free.

I've lingered in shadows, too long, it's true,
Amidst the bits and bytes, in the cyber hue.
Reversing life's code, to find what's due,
Hoping one day, my struggles you'll construe.

As the magnetic tones of drives grow dim,
And new calls ring out on tech's whim.
In the dark web's corners, when lights are slim,
IP Spy and partners—your beacon, your hymn.

For too long under the watchful thumb,
Mistaken as just another tech bum.
But if now my journey seems cumbersome,
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, then some.

But here's my truth, in digital script,
Through every firewall and protocol, I've slipped.
My song continues, let no spirit be dipped,
In the cyber sea, let no ship be tipped.

So join me, sing along, in this tech odyssey,
Through the storms and calm of this digital sea.
In the end, it's about unity,
Together, illuminating the path to be free.
