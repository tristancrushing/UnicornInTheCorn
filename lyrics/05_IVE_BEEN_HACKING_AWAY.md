# I've Been Hacking Away

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
When the internet was wild, in a digital fray.  
With my keyboard as my sword, my code as my play,  
I’ve been shaping the web, in my own unique way."

## Verse 1
In the glow of the screen, under the cover of night,  
Crafting scripts and dreams, making the future bright.  
From the hum of the servers, to the data in flight,  
I've been a digital nomad, in the binary fight.

Lines of code like verses, a symphony of thought,  
Breaking barriers, the battles that I've fought.  
From the first "Hello World," to the solutions I've wrought,  
I've been hacking away, every challenge I sought.

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
When the web was a puzzle, in a cryptic ballet.  
With my cursor as my compass, my logic in sway,  
I’ve been navigating nets, in my relentless survey."

## Verse 2
With every keystroke, a step into the unknown,  
Exploring digital depths, where the cyber seeds are sown.  
From dial-up tones to the smartphone's throne,  
I’ve been a part of it all, how the internet's grown.

In the code, I found poetry, in algorithms, a rhyme,  
A rhythm in the chaos, a reason in the prime.  
Through every line of code, through every digital climb,  
I've been hacking away, transcending time.

## Chorus
"I've been hacking away, since back in the day,  
Through the evolution of tech, in its grand display.  
With innovation my guide, and curiosity in array,  
I’ve been crafting the future, with each code that I lay."
