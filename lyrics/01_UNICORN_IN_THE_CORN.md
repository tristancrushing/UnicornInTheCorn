# UNICORN IN THE CORN

## Verse 1:
You're a unicorn ðŸ¦„ so you better perform!  
Full stack developer who grew up in the corn ðŸŒ½  
Wit sharp as a thorn, he codes up a storm,  
From dusk until dawn, his ideas take form.  
A maverick in tech, where norms are reborn,  
In the land of the husk, his genius was sworn.  
Heâ€™s scaled start-ups that had bloated infrastructure,  
Giving the recurring cost some liposuction and acupuncture.

## Verse 2:
He was monitoring everything in real time like a precog,  
He could predict outages ahead of time, no need to blog.  
Navigating through digital clutter and fracture,  
His code slices through excess like a raptor.  
Visions of downtime in his mind's architecture,  
Forecasting the faults with precognitive texture.  
On the net's waves, he's the prime navigator,  
A silicon sage, an uptime curator.

## Hook:
In the heart of the maze, where the digital storms are born,  
You're a unicorn ðŸ¦„, so you better perform!  
Full-stack developer who grew up in the corn ðŸŒ½,  
Crafting the future, from night until morn.

## Verse 3:
In the cyber realm, where threats silently swarm,  
He stands guard, a sentinel, in digital form.  
With ipspy.net, his creation, in the cyber night,  
He tracks the shadows, bringing breaches to light.  
A wizard in security, casting encryption spells,  
Guarding the gates, where the data dwells.  
From phishing scams to malwareâ€™s harsh bite,  
He battles the darkness, a knight in byte.

## Verse 4:
With a name that turns heads, his code libs, a bold claim,  
"Fucq" they're called, in GitHub's hall of fame.  
A suite of tools, each a masterpiece, a gem,  
Crafted with care, they outshine the mainstream's mayhem.  
From FucqEgress to FucqThat, his creativity knows no bounds,  
In the realm of code, where innovation abounds.  
A pioneer, a poet, in the open-source land,  
His contributions, a guide, for the developer's hand.

## Verse 5:
In the digital dojo, where knowledge is power,  
He founded ShieldSkills, a towering cyber tower.  
Teaching the masses, with passion and flair,  
The basics of security, making them aware.  
From phishing defenses to password sage advice,  
He empowers the users, no need to think twice.  
A mentor, a guide, in the cyber seas,  
He navigates the novices with the greatest of ease.

## Verse 6:
On LinkedIn's vast stage, where professionals meet,  
Tristan's presence shines, a feat hard to beat.  
With a following vast, hanging on every word,  
His insights and musings, far and wide, are heard.  
A beacon of knowledge in the digital tide,  
Where novices and experts alike confide.  
His network, a testament to his widespread acclaim,  
In the tech community, a respected name.
