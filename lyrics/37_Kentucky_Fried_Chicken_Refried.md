They don't know I'm the Chicken Man, These Cocks, Follow My Hand! 
Call me the rooster! Call me the BOOSTEr, You just a Hen, You in my Pin!
Don't Play Chicken, cuz I'm no Chicken! I get Able Lincoln, if Pissy Pussies Start Stinkin.
My Glocks Stay Blinking, Until the Silencers go on, and I play until dawn. 

I've Got Cross Roads, I've got Old Hoes, With BUT LOADs of Money! 
They throw it around me, Think my anger is Funny. Because when I go Viral, It goes Viral.
I got no reasons, To Commit Treason, Try to tell Sheeple, I'm the king of the Cyber Sec Kingdom.

They never listen, Hacked 3 times since 0 2 Damn bretheren how could you?
I thought we were cool? Why you want me to die homie?

All my big boys, will go play with big toys, in differnt sections of MIC erections.
I'll putba soldier on every branch from every ranch.

I'm never Blanched!
