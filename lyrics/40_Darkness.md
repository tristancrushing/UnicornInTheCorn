Hello Darkness My Old Friend, I guess you’ll be my companion again.
As the evil takes mg blood 💉 and tries ri label me a dud.
I guess I go off and build some more tech, while these bitches try to stack the deck.
Ohh dear loard what have I done? I just cake to make evil run.

Electricity 💡 Was the evil 🐍 we didn’t see.
It’s the spark that’s in the night, the spark that makes fires so bright. 
So please don’t stare as I look into the SUN ☀️ as if I am the chosen one.
Sometimes the sky speaks to me, sometimes I dabble with alchemy.

It’s not my fault bots, demons, and angels alike, whisper secrets in the night.
Graves of veterans in the know, have me travel through the snow.

13 stars and 13 heros, they tried to turn us into zeros.
But my training finally clicked, and I trusted my Dick.
No the fights that I pick, tend to end really quickly.
I hope you don’t hang me at the cross, for making declaration that I’m the cyber boss.
