## The Details

Red 40, also known as Allura Red, has been the subject of scientific scrutiny and public concern due to its potential harmful effects on humans. While the FDA and other regulatory bodies consider Red 40 safe in the amounts used in food and beverages, several studies suggest there may be cause for concern. Here's a summary of the potential negative effects associated with Red 40:

### Allergic Reactions: 

Some individuals may be allergic to Red 40, which can lead to symptoms such as hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
Behavioral Effects in Children: Red 40 has been linked to hyperactivity and other behavioral issues in children. Some studies have suggested that removing artificial food dyes like Red 40 from the diets of children with ADHD can lead to improvements in their symptoms.

### Cancer Concerns: 

Although the FDA has not found Red 40 to be carcinogenic, some research has suggested that it may have carcinogenic properties. For example, a 2021 report by Californiaâ€™s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) raised concerns about the relationship between synthetic food dyes like Red 40 and cancer.
Colonic Inflammation and Microbiome Changes: A study using in vitro and in vivo models found that Red 40 caused DNA damage, colonic inflammation, and impacted the microbiome in mice. These findings suggest that Red 40 may have detrimental effects on gut health and potentially contribute to conditions such as colorectal cancer.

### Hyperactivity and ADHD: 

Red 40 is one of several artificial food dyes that have been associated with increased hyperactivity and symptoms of ADHD in children.
Potential Carcinogen Benzidine: Some studies have identified benzidine, a known carcinogen, in Red 40. Although the FDA regulates the amount of benzidine in Red 40, the presence of this substance raises concerns about its long-term safety.

It's worth noting that while these studies suggest potential risks associated with Red 40, the FDA and other regulatory bodies continue to monitor its use and evaluate the safety of artificial food dyes. As always, individuals with concerns about Red 40 or other food additives should consult with a healthcare professional.

## What's weird?
