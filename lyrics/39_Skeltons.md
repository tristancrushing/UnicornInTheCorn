My protoypes were prototyped before i ever relased any protypes.
I've got hype, been trained on dirt bikes, races on dirt tracks, have cartied dirt on my back.
I'm so sorry, I didn't buy you a ring, Bug Rogers & Hollands, Cuz they know I bring the bling.
If you act right, I buy you Becks and Diamond rings.
If you act wrong, I'll write a song, and all my homies will sing along.

Stop be shifty, Jake spotted you before 50.
You can play me, Dr Dre beats raised me.
Shady Bitches, Shady Snitches, Shady Ladies.
All they want is payment Babies.

These damaged honeys, can't commit to no body.
They always running, when dumpster fires start coming.
I prepped for thus round, I wrote it all down, I have recording,
A institution will pay for your boarding.

Keep lying on me, and all your friend and exes, will need new vest kid.
Bullet proof papers, I onow the drapers.
I reapalter all of the alter. I'm not olaying, demons I'm slayjng.
If you pass my judgement, you won't have to rush it.

I don't give more than 10 years, if you can't stop fuckong with Queers,
you sweat n sweat are just friends, bitch hes been Bi since HighSchool.
Don't quiz me, I'll make your head dizzy.
You ain't read shit kid, I be readijg to fill my lid.

You aren't even welcome at book clubs, so why did you shove?
